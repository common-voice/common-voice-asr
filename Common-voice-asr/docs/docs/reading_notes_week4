# PyTorch CTCLoss documentation
CTC loss
- Calculates loss between a continuous (unsegmented) time series and a target sequence
- alignment of input to target is assumed to be “many-to-one”, which limits the length of the target sequence <= input length
Shape:
- Log_probs: Tensor of size (T,N,C) where T = input length, N = bat
