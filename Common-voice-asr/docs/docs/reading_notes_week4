# PyTorch CTCLoss documentation
CTC loss
- Calculates loss between a continuous (unsegmented) time series and a target sequence
- alignment of input to target is assumed to be “many-to-one”, which limits the length of the target sequence <= input length
Shape:
- Log_probs: Tensor of size (T,N,C) where T = input length, N = batch size, & C = # classes. Log probability of outputs
- Targets: Tensor of size (N, S) where S = max target lengths. Represents target sequences, each element is a class index that cannot be blank
- Inputs_lengths: tuple/sensor of size (N) or (). Represents lengths of inputs, must be <= T. Lengths specified for each sequence to achieve masking
- Target_lengths: Tuple or tensor of size (N) or (). Represents lengths of targets, specified for each sequence to achieve masking
- Output: scalar if reduction is 'mean' (default) or 'sum'. (N) if input is batched or () if input is unbatched if reduction is 'none'
